Education is too costly and is a product instead of being a way to change your life.,Make government schools better by employing trained professionals invited by a good pay. And ensure that passouts have adequate opportunities possibly in government or even private institutions.,Decision making and problem solving should be emphasized the most in schools.,Focus on foundational problem solving skills. And then building on top of that on how to understand and utilitize different real world tools to solve problems.,"Professors can be incentivised to get industry people to co tech some on their course so that graduates get a feel for industry skills and how to develop them. Alternatively there can be courses which train select skills, which should be made optional but should teach the attendees the relevant skills if they are willing to learn.","Ai and digital tools can expedite the teaching process tremendously. One professor used AI to generate slides and homeworks, but that only augmented his teaching giving time for him to do other things. In this way AI can be used to help teachers speed up things so that they may better focus on more important matters.","In recent times, almost everyone has access to the internet, but technology wise, schools should invest in some lab area or servers so that students can use/ssh to get work done.","Yes, it provides a more feasible way to keep steady lectures and tools to enhance learning. It can be used in ways to conduct fun quizzes(without marks) and even recorded videos for futher understanding.",Higher wage schemes in general and better bonuses based on through review of their teaching. Anonymous course feedback can help decide this along with some investigation on how well the teachers are teaching.,"Public schools don't have enough infrastructure and opportunities as private schools while private schools are just money making schemes selling the product called education to parents of unfortunate kids. Overall both are the same, absolute garbage in their end result where kids take away nothing except how to memorize things and fake knowledge until they get caught.","School wise feedback collectors can facilitate forms to fillout and collect opinions of parents and children, format this information and send it to a higher post. This statewise entity(possibly of finer grained institutions wouldn't work out) could combine the details and present it to education ministry for a representative of the voice of parents, students and teachers.",Forcebly lowering the school fees that private institutions demand by law. This would greatly reduce the burden on many families to send their kids to school and stop those moneysuckers from pocketing so much money.
"Lack of direction as to where people are going, and why they're doing it. Not only do they not have a ""why they need to learn"", the teachers need to opt a why oriented approach while teaching the concepts as well.",Result oriented education for the masses. These need to be tailored as per socioeconomic needs as well as have a more open ended option for those who have clear self made goals.,"Given the changing times and needs, something focussed more on human engineering and interaction. Something that helps socially.

Apart from this, money making skills as seemed plausible and necessary.","Planning based on a goal-oriented view that helps employment. Our country's populace has a need to get out of poverty cycles, tailor our curriculum and plans based on this. Advise from corporate leaders as per their learnings and what they find useful is  certainyl a helpful viewpoint in the planning committee.",Better collaboration with industry.,"I'm honestly against AI, I feel it will make finding a job harder :(. But also, it can be used to delegate menial grunt work while students focus more on ideation and the creative aspects. But by doing this I'm afraid people will lose touch with hard and monotonous work though, that helps in building character as well.",Beyond the scope of my knowledge.,"Certainly, as mentioned above we can delegate certain unnecessarily time consuming tasks to certain online resources while we focus on the creative. Also, this will allow access to wider range of resources.

As for the distraction potential. This is life, they need to face it and get over their addictions.  Else they're sure to mess up when they no longer have a restriction placed on them in the future.",Beyond the scope of my reasoning.,"Private has better access to resources, and has a clear goal to provide the students with what they're looking for. A public school doesn't generally work in such a straightforward long temr goal oriented manner, cause they lack ""skin in the game"" so to speak.

Private school's cash inflow depend on how well they've helped the student in accomplishing what they want.",Beyond the scope of my competence.,"As mentioned previously, goal and reult oriented education would suit our current requirements."
"Primary Education has to be restructured to accommodate and may be more emphasis on maths, science and economics. Its outdated and the institutes require more skilled teachers!","I assume hiring worthy and good people in teaching by acknowledging the fact that without providing any good benefits, no skilled teacher are applying for the job. This should solve the issue of skilled teachers in government schools. And may be requirement of teaching certificate for both government schools and private!","schools should emphasize more on criticial thinking, digital literacy and of course interdisciplinary working ability"," project-based learning, industry collaboration, and skills like communication, adaptability, and data fluency should help in bridging the gap ","Universities and industries can collaborate through internship programs, joint research projects, guest lectures, and co-designed curricula to ensure students gain hands-on experience and skills aligned with current market needs. ","I think khanimgo is trying out this idea which I personally liked. 

AI and digital tools should act as personalized learning companions, helping tailor content to individual student needs, pace, and interests, while also automating routine tasks for educators.","Equal access can be ensured through public-private partnerships that invest in infrastructure, subsidized devices, and community internet hubs (something like digital library), especially in underserved areas. ","yes, online learning should be integrated more as it offers flexibility and opportunity for self paced, diverse learning experiences.","Policies should focus on fair compensation, reduced administrative burdens and continuous professional development to empower teachers.","My understanding is private schools just makes the gap between the rich and the poor wider. Although, practically speaking, private schools often drive innovation or provide good skillset to students since they are competitive. 

Anyway, the focus should be on raising standard across the public schools and matching the bar as private schools. A healthy competition helps both the side thrive and grow together.","Creating inclusive forums, school boards, and regular feedback mechanisms where parents, teachers, and students can share input ensures that policies reflect real classroom needs.","I never liked the idea of exams. Assessing students more on their ability to solve problems on assignments and assessing through projects should significantly change in the way many students think. Although, I believe, 2 exams in a semester helps students focus and get their act together before hell breaks loose."
"Quality of education is bad, teach outdated useless things","By making it completely opensource, the best material. Like make elite institution level material open source to everyone. ","Maths, physics, comp sci, economics, negotiation",change the curriculum frequently ( every 3-4 years ) with the changing dynamics of society and the current job/research requirements.,keep a practical/research led teaching for every grade,"Should help people advance as fast as they can in their learning,  the system of ""grade/standard"" should be abolished",set an opensource standard baseline that is regarded good enough by actual researchers and practitioners in the industry rather than trusting some government official to do it.,"Yes, doesnt slow down or increase the pace of learning for each student",Make a rigorous selection process so that only teachers passionate to teach take up the role. No other way around this AI will take their jobs easily if they are just teaching for a wage,Public should always try and match up to the best of private,education policy must be decided researchers/practitioners from relevant industries in close observation while testing out on students. ,"integrate AI agents, lol"
Awareness is a big one and lack of guidance is another ,Provide internet and open a centralised public domain library on the net ,Programming or applied mathematics in real life,"Work on actual skill/craft over just theory , through collaboration with actual industry which meet a minimum standard .","Provide certain courses which our mentored by industry pros and use it as a talent search scheme , (a vague solution)",Knowledge based learning will become obsolete ,"Cheaper internet is the standard answer , so awareness campaigns could help as well .",Maybe not as online learning is best suited when the actual individual is motivated,"Maybe recording standard based lectures , and focusing on building meaningful projects could help.",Private schools need to meet a certain level of standard in opportunity & education .,"Use the mass media to show the current scenario of our system and, our various prospects & negatives .","A non corrupt quality board to figure out under standard institutes , to either develop them or propose a alternative solution"
"Unfit primary teachers (for most schools), concentration of quality in the elite. Lack of organization and network within schools.","Increased state funding for primary school, extension of meal schemes to private schools. Private sector collaboration for infrastructure.","Numeracy, survey skills, cooking, language (especially english).",Inclusion of network building and administrative subjects in the curriculum.,"Through setting up and strengthening collaborative labs tackling problem statement, and giving such labs autonomy to offer courses.",LLMs for Minimization of communication barrier. Deep search engines to Counter lack of resources (or clarity in resources),Running labs with internet connectivity in school (beyond school hours) for students.,Completion of classes online should be considered as attendance. Exams could be made online if needed. But I do not see major pros and cons compared to non-online setups.,Exemption of govt teachers from election duty and other mandated non-teachimg work. Extension of retirement age for teachers and researchers.,"Ideally they should not be much different, and there should be collaboration.","A link could be established between a sampled community of parents, teachers and students to the government through education boards. And perhaps a representative of this community in the advisory of the education minister. ","Focus in both policy and funds for primary and secondary education, at the level of state funded universities."
Lack of financial cognisance and too little emphasis on communication skills,Improve the situation of government schools,Finance and professional communication ,I think it should be updated with relevance to the work required in the world more often than it is now,Keeping their syllabuses upto date and giving them more industry related exposure,"I’m not sure, but one would argue its goal should be to help with all redundant tasks ",We can provide enough access to them in schools and colleges eventually and make learning about them and using them as part of the curriculum ,"Online learning often ignores the essential qualities learnt in a classroom, so no. ",Getting in more rewards and bonuses for teachers based on students’ reviews and training the teachers to better adapt to the fast changing curriculum that will be needed to improve education overall ,"Right now, private schools generally tend to give a better output, the goal should be to make public schools much better to make education more reachable to all",Out of my scope,Updating curriculum more often as is required
Outdated ,More funding and better maintenance of government academic facilities ,"English, Math , Science ",Industry knowledge along with theory ,More collaboration between the two ,Help clear doubts and help students practice concepts ,Low barrier to entry ,Yess helps students learn at their own pace,Encourage and enable self-care.,"Public schools, with their focus on accessibility and affordability, play a vital role in providing education to all, while private schools can offer specialized programs and potentially smaller class sizes, each serving different needs within the educational landscape. 
",Open discussions ,We should start treating that every profession is important. And also promoting the business culture in our country. School should start appointing teacher for skills learning. Also they can Collab with some trainers
Fair and accessible education to all (especially rural areas). Education being relevant with the changing times (Especially in rural areas).,They can use AI to replace teachers (They have a teacher shortage). Give incentives to go to school. Build boarding schools for parents who might migrate a lot.,"Logical reasoning, math and science (Too much psuedo science going on). Moral values and Physical education","Use AI, train teachers to adapt to the modern workforce.",Industry should hire people who give courses in universities and then give internships to students who are good and interested and give PPO,They should help in assisting the student in learning. AI should be used less by students in the early ages to improve cognitive abilities ,"Have internet at all schools, give rental tabs to students in school for learning","Yes, it reduces the burden on teachers. Students should be taught how to deal with online addiction","Have lesser teachers, train them well, give them better pay. ","Public education should be decent at the minimum, else private schools do random fee hikes as they like. The state of public educcaiton in india sucks",Education policy is not an election issue because most voters are poor and uneducated. Also they have their agenda rather than better education for future. Having more educated India should help with this,"Mandatory education (Not right, mandatory)"
Explaination of the concepts in practical way for better understanding which is one of the challenge and this even reduces the literacy rate and economy of country,By ensuring and establishing certain standards of policies that makes the understanding of educational concepts in more practical manner and remembering for longer time,"Skills like communication and leadership are most essential in current generation for achieving  better heights in successful carrer
for an individual.","The education system should prioritize adaptable skills like critical thinking, creativity, and digital literacy, while introducing more project-based learning that solves real-world problems.","Universities should establish robust internship programs, connect with industry professionals, and design curriculum that integrates practical skills training alongside academic knowledge.","AI and digital tools should be viewed as enhancement technologies that personalize learning, provide adaptive tutoring, and help students develop technological fluency, while maintaining human teaching as the core educational concepts.","Community-driven technology lending programs, public-private partnerships, and targeted infrastructure investments in underserved areas can help bridge the digital divide and ensure equitable technological access.","Online learning should be strategically integrated as a complementary approach, not a complete replacement.","Policy reforms should focus on competitive salary structures, reduced administrative burden by increasing perks, professional development opportunities, and creating supportive institutional environments that respect teachers' expertise.","A balanced educational ecosystem requires strong public schools as the foundation, with private schools serving as innovative spaces that can pilot educational approaches, ultimately benefiting the broader educational landscape.","Create formal representation mechanisms like elected educational councils, regular community forums, and transparent policy development processes that actively solicit input from students, parents, and educators.","Implementing a more holistic, individualized assessment approach that moves beyond standardized testing, recognizing diverse forms of intelligence and learning potential while providing personalized educational pathways,also by implementating the concept of understanding real time implementation."
Too much knowledge which isn't applicable for someone's job. To get into IT everything that I've learnt till 12th was practically useless.,"Don't think it's possible, but sure open enough schools and colleges if you can finance that somehow.","Maths, useful in almost every field.","Specialisation at an earlier stage, instead of choosing what they do after 10th and then preparing 2 years on something that might not be necessary, make the exams relevant to what course is being applied for. So instead of grinding mpc to get into CS someone would instead be grinding coding which means when they actually get in they know something about CS and didn't get in because they grinded something unrelated.","Internships, great, already happening.",Personalized education,Government approved video lectures for standard boards like cbse and all.,"Yes, allows more freedom for students to learn and brings out their potential rather than forcing them into a rigid system and only seeing those who perform well in this system shine.",Better tools for easily interacting with students through platforms,"Private schools are important, they outline what the government fails to bring to the table and how much better it could be. Ideally government schools are at the level of private schools but that's a utopia never to be.","Democracy, do voting.","Making the system more about completion rather than competition.
If a student can complete his task, then he should be recieving the highest grade regardless of how well or poor his peers perform."
